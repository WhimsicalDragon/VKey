This is a keyboard visualization program for vtubers who code!
You can move the window with the arrow keys.
The keys you type will be highlighted when typing.

Please be careful! Do not use this software when typing passwords or usernames
on stream to avoid getting your account stolen. In the future I intend to add
some features to help prevent this from happening, but for now it's on you to
be security careful.
